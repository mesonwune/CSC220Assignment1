Homework #1: Methods, Strings, and ArrayLists
I compiled my project using the IDE IntelliJ and what it does is take in the user's String
and calls the two methods StrToTokens and getLetterFreq to print the string 
split up by either whitespaces, commas, or periods and print the number of
occurrences of each letter in the string.
